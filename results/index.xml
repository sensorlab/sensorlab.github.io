It provides a CLI tool written in Golang that lets you set up, upgrade, scale, and destroy Kubernetes clusters. Under the hood, it uses Terraform along with terraform-libvirt-provider to deploy virtual machines on target hosts running libvirt. Kubernetes is configured on the deployed virtual machines using Kubespray, the popular open source project.</description></item><item><title>UWB Localization Dataset</title><link>https://sensorlab.github.io/results/uwb-dataset/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sensorlab.github.io/results/uwb-dataset/</guid><description>UWB localization data set contains measurements from four different indoor environments. The data set contains measurements that can be used for range-based localization evaluation in different indoor environments using 9 DW1000 UWB transceivers (DWM1000 modules) connected to the networked RaspberryPi computer using in-house radio board SNPN_UWB. 8 nodes were used as localization anchor nodes with fixed locations in individual indoor environment and one node was used as a mobile localization tag.</description></item><item><title>LPWAN Trace Set</title><link>https://sensorlab.github.io/results/ws-traffic-dataset/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sensorlab.github.io/results/ws-traffic-dataset/</guid><description>A dataset containing 24 hours of continuous spectrum measurements. A proprietary spectrum sensing device placed on top of a building in a mid-sized European city recorded 5 PSD measurements per second using 1024 FFT bins in a 192 kHz wide band inside the unlicensed European 868 MHz SRD band.</description></item><item><title>LOG-a-TEC</title><link>https://sensorlab.github.io/results/log-a-tec/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sensorlab.github.io/results/log-a-tec/</guid><description>LOG-a-TEC is a diverse testbed used for research purposes. It started in 2016 and evolved overtime into its third iteration. It covers ultra narrow band and ultra wide band, packet based experimentation, clean slate protocol design, composable and modular protocol stacks, custom and advanced spectrum sensing and signal generating functions in sub-GHz spectrum.</description></item></channel></rss>
