&lt;p>&lt;strong>Description:&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The position focuses on the generation of network configurations, such as Service Function Chaining (SFC), by framing it as a planning problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This problem will be tackled using a wide range of AI methods, including Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning, Neural Algorithmic Reasoning, Reinforcement Learning, etc. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work in an international environment and build a pan-European collaborative network by working on EU-funded collaborative projects.
