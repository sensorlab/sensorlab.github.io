Our recent work using [shallow](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355105512_Designing_a_Machine_Learning_based_Non-intrusive_Load_Monitoring_Classifier) and [deep](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355105822_Learning_to_Automatically_Identify_Home_Appliances) machine learning methods is documented in two recent papers and the code is available also as a [CaaS service](https://github.com/sensorlab/ApplianceCaaS).
