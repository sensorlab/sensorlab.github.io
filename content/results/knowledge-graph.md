title: Electricity knowledge graph datasets

summary: >
    The repository includes downloads for the datasets and all the neccesary code to run the pipeline for preprocessing the data and generating the knowledge graph. The knowledge graph is generated from a set of raw datasets containing electricity consumption data from multiple regions and households. The data is preprocessed and harmonized to generate a knowledge graph containing information about the households, appliances, and electricity consumption. We also provide a model training pipeline that can be used to train a model for on/off appliance classification.
