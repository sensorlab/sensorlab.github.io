title: Kubitect
summary: Kubitect is an open source project that aims to simplify the deployment and subsequent management of Kubernetes clusters. It provides a CLI tool written in Golang that lets you set up, upgrade, scale, and destroy Kubernetes clusters. Under the hood, it uses Terraform along with terraform-libvirt-provider to deploy virtual machines on target hosts running libvirt. Kubernetes is configured on the deployed virtual machines using Kubespray, the popular open source project.
