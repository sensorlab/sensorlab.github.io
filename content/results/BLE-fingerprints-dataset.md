title: "BLE Fingerprints Dataset"

summary: >
    The available dataset contains received signal strength (RSS) measurements made with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology, which can be used for outdoor fingerprinting based localization applications. The dataset was collected with 25 nodes of the LOG-a-TEC testbed positioned at the campus of the Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana.
