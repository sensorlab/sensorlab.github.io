title: LPWAN Trace Set
summary: A dataset containing 24 hours of continuous spectrum measurements. A proprietary spectrum sensing device placed on top of a building in a mid-sized European city recorded 5 PSD measurements per second using 1024 FFT bins in a 192 kHz wide band inside the unlicensed European 868 MHz SRD band.
