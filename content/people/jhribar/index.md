Jernej Hribar is a [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action Fellow](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships) in the [Department of Communication Systems](https://e6.ijs.si/) since October 2022. His MSCA action - TimeSmart - investigates the applicability of the novel Age of Information metric in smart grids. From 2019-2022, he was a postdoctoral researcher in the [CONNECT Centre](https://connectcentre.ie/) for Future Networks and Communications at [Trinity College Dublin, Ireland](https://www.tcd.ie/). He was involved in an international collaborative project between Trinity College Dublin and [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) using machine learning techniques to assist future networks with decision-making problems in smart cities. He received an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from the [University of Ljubljana](https://www.uni-lj.si/eng/), Slovenia, in 2014 and a Ph.D. from Trinity College Dublin, Ireland, in 2020. His PhD focused on improving the sustainability of large-scale sensor deployments using reinforcement learning and leveraging the freshness of correlated information measured by the Age of Information metric.
