I received my Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana, in September 2023. Currently I am enrolled in the master’s study programme in Electrical Engineering, module - Information and Communication technologies, at the same Faculty. I joined Sensorlab in September 2023. My research interests include time series analysis (time series segmentation, clustering, anomaly detection and forecasting), through the use of graph-based methodologies and graph neural networks.
