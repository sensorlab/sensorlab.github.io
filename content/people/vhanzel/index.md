I received my bachelor’s degree in Computer and Information Science from the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science. Currently, I am pursuing a master’s degree in Data Science at the Technical University of Graz. My research interests include knowledge graphs and anomaly detection on time series data using deep learning.
