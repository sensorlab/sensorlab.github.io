I received my Master’s degree in communication engineering from National Chung Cheng University (CCU), Taiwan in 2014 and a Ph.D. from Queen’s University, Belfast, U.K. in 2023. My Ph.D. focused on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS/IRS), more specifically, the real-world setup and optimization of RIS-aided wireless systems.
