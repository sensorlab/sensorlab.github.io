Time series anomaly detection is an important and yet unsolved challenge that is relevant for developing, maintaining and monitoring various aspects of smart infrastructures. One of our original contributions to the area consists in the definition of [four types of anomalies](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9264175) relevant for monitoring the quality of the wireless links between various smart objects. A second original contribution consists of using [time series to image transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00972) for advancing the state of the art in detection performance.
