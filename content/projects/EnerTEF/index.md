# Short summary of the project
summary: "EnerTEF responds to the soaring demand for reliable AI products in the evolving energy sector. It pioneers a Common Federated AI Testing and Experimentation Facility to bridge the gap between demand and limited availability of rigorously tested AI products. Aligned with European Commission initiatives, EnerTEF leverages foundational projects like the Common European Energy Data Space and AIoD. Through specialized 'AI Living Labs,' EnerTEF fosters collaboration between energy stakeholders and AI developers to create adaptive models that align with evolving energy systems. 'Bridging Centralized Access' ensures data privacy and security in federated testing, adhering to EU regulations and addressing ethical concerns. 'Seamless Federated Integration' tackles integrating AI technologies across domains, enhancing cross-sector collaboration. 'Long-term Sustainability and Go-to-Market Strategy' focuses on bringing AI innovations to market."
