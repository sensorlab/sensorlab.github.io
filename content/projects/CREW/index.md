# Short summary of the project
summary: "The main target of the Cognitive Radio Experimentation World â€“ CREW project is to establish an open federated test platform, which facilitates experimentally-driven research on advanced spectrum sensing, cognitive radio and cognitive networking strategies in view of horizontal and vertical spectrum sharing in licensed and unlicensed bands.

The CREW platform incorporates 5 individual wireless testbeds incorporating diverse wireless technologies (heterogeneous ISM, heterogeneous licensed, cellular, wireless sensor) augmented with State-of-the-Art cognitive sensing platforms.

The CREW project started in October 2010 with a consortium of 7 partners and was enlarged in July 2011 with the 8th partner. To extend the use of the federated testbeds to external researchers, two open calls are planned.

Our role: Deploying an outdoor wireless testbed LOG-a-TEC and establishing an open federated test platform, which facilitates experimentally-driven research on advanced spectrum sensing, cognitive radio and cognitive networking strategies in view of horizontal and vertical spectrum sharing in licensed and unlicensed bands."
