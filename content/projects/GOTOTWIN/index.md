The GoToTwin project addresses the common challenge of accelerating the adoption and integration of renewable energy sources in the Adriatic Ionian region. The project leverages digital twin technology to tackle pressing energy and sustainability issues in the region. The overall objective of the project is to establish a robust and transnational digital twin framework tailored for renewable energy applications. This framework will enable stakeholders to effectively manage energy systems, optimise resource utilisation, and enhance overall system efficiency. By harnessing advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and data analytics, stakeholders will be empowered to make well-informed decisions and maximise renewable energy generation.
