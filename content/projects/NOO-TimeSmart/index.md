# Short summary of the project
summary: "The MSCA PF TimeSmart project continues under additional ARIS funding through the NOO initiative, supporting the reintegration and further international engagement of Slovenian researchers. The work of NOO TimeSmart focuses on advancing the practical deployment, robustness, and scalability of the methods developed in the MSCA TimeSmart fellowship. The project strengthens cloud-enabled processing of timely information, integrates AoI-aware forecasting and intelligent energy management into operational frameworks, and evaluates their performance in larger, more diverse smart-grid settings. By deepening the role of the Age of Information in real-time decision-making and coordination across distributed energy assets, the project moves the TimeSmart concepts closer to real-world readiness."

The MSCA PF project TimeSmart received further funding funded by ARIS through Načrt za okrevanje in odpornost (NOO) initiative ("krepitev mednarodne mobilnosti slovenskih raziskovalcev in raziskovalnih organizacij ter za spodbujanje mednarodne vpetosti slovenskih prijaviteljev" (sklop B)).

## Scope of the NOO project MN-0009

The NOO re-integration Timesmart project aims to advance the practical deployment, robustness, and scalability of the approaches developed in the MSCA PF TimeSmart project. Building on the foundations of timeliness-aware data processing, AoI-guided forecasting, and intelligent energy management, the project will further integrate these components into cohesive, operational frameworks suitable for real-world use. A central focus is to take advantage of cloud infrastructure, ensuring that timely information can be processed, exchanged, and acted upon efficiently across distributed energy systems. The project will also explore larger and more diverse smart-grid environments to assess how these methods scale, adapt to uncertainty, and interact with complex community-level dynamics. Particular emphasis is placed on advancing and deepening the role of the Age of Information (AoI) in smart grid decision-making, testing how AoI-driven insights can improve responsiveness, stability, and coordination across households, storage systems, and electric vehicles. Through these efforts, the project aims to bring the developed concepts closer to operational readiness and prepare the ground for future pilots and broader adoption.
