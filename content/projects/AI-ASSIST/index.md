# Short summary of the project
summmary: "The AI-ASSIST project focuses on developing a real-time dynamic stability assessment (DSA) tool for electric power systems, using artificial intelligence to enhance stability monitoring in response to rapidly changing environmental and technological demands. The project aims to integrate advanced monitoring infrastructure with AI techniques to predict and address potential instabilities in power systems. Organizations involved in this initiative include the University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Electrical Engineering (UL-FE), the Jožef Stefan Institute (JSI), and ELES, Slovenia’s national transmission system operator. The Jožef Stefan Institute is responsible for developing and optimizing AI techniques for database management and real-time recognition of power system conditions."
