# Short summary of the project
summary: "AeroDrops is the first device capable of selectively detecting airborne droplets in real time. The device detects and count respiratory droplets, enabling smart, data-driven ventilation control that helps reducing infection risk – addressing a key public health challenge highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic.The technology was developed at the Jožef Stefan Institute. To raise the technology readiness level and bring solution closer to the market, the project received funding through RSF-IND call at JSI. Departments F5 and E6 are collaborating with industrial partners Nanotul d.o.o. and Comsensus d.o.o. to develop a market-ready device and further develop the technology."

AeroDrops is the first device capable of selectively detecting airborne droplets in real time. The device detects and count respiratory droplets, enabling smart, data-driven ventilation control that helps reducing infection risk – addressing a key public health challenge highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The technology was developed at the [Jožef Stefan Institute](https://ijs.si/ijsw/V001/JSI). To raise the technology readiness level and bring solution closer to the market, the project received funding through RSF-IND call at JSI. Departments [F5](https://www-f5.ijs.si/en) and [E6](https://e6.ijs.si/) are collaborating with industrial partners [Nanotul d.o.o.](https://nanotul.com/) and [Comsensus d.o.o.](https://www.comsensus.eu/) to develop a market-ready device and further develop the technology.

The AeroDrops project receives funding from the Jožef Stefan Institute's RSF-IND call.
