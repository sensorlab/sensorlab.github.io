# Project's title
title: "GENOME: GENerative and connected intelligence for 6G Open ManagemEnt"

# Short summary of the project
summary: "AI and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to handle complex tasks across many fields. In network management, they offer powerful tools to automate operations, improve efficiency, and optimise performance. Supported by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions programme, the GENOME project aims to design, develop, and test LLM-based solutions for the autonomous management of different network domains."

AI and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to handle complex tasks across many fields. In network management, they offer powerful tools to automate operations, improve efficiency, and optimise performance. Supported by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions programme, the GENOME project aims to design, develop, and test LLM-based solutions for the autonomous management of different network domains. Using task-agnostic network functions and intent-based networking, it intends to create an intelligence framework that enables coordination, rapid learning, and conflict-free decision-making, strengthening both efficiency and resilience.
