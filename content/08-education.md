We offer various activities targeting education and knowledge transfer. Through our work with undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate students on individual cutting edge projects and their theses, we make sure they are better prepared for the market needs. We also organize summer schools, tutorials at conferences and locally in collaboration with the University of Ljubljana and the Jozef Stefan Internation Postgraduate School. For general practitioners and decision makers we also reccommend the edited book [The Internet of Things: From Data to Insight](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Internet+of+Things%3A+From+Data+to+Insight-p-9781119545262){:target="_blank"}.
