Automation infrastructure for developing testing and deploying software for embedded/constrained devices is currently approaching market adoption. Our group pioneered continuous integration for embedded development by proposing the [COINS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8515680) framework and then implementing and evaluating it on [LOG-a-TEC](http://log-a-tec.eu/index.html). We also touched on improving the efficiency of [zero-touch](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9348119) device provisionining.
