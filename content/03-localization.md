Location based services, already popular with end users, are now inevitably becoming part of new  wireless infrastructures and emerging business processes. The increasingly popular Deep Learning (DL) artificial intelligence methods perform very well in wireless fingerprinting localization based on extensive indoor radio measurement data. Check out our work and datasets on improving ML based localization using traces from the [LOG-a-TEC](http://log-a-tec.eu/uwb-ds.html) testbed and soon to come sustainable fingerprinting.
