Wireless links are crucial to cost efficiently connecting various components in smart infrastructures. Recently, machine learning techniques proved to be suitable for more accurate estimation and classification. As original contribution to this area, we provide a comprehensive [survey](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9333616) on link quality estimators developed from empirical data and then focus on the subset that use ML algorithms. We analyze ML-based Link Quality Estimation (LQE) models from two perspectives using performance data. Firstly, we focus on how they address quality requirements that are important from the perspective of the applications they serve. Secondly, we analyze how they approach the standard design steps commonly used in the ML community.
