Department of Communication Systems will be mainly concerned with solutions for radio localization of victims or first responders, basic infrastructure-less communication and crowd-sensing solutions. Department of Knowledge Technologies will focus on real-time sentiment analysis from social media and news, and crowdsensing data analytics from device measurements.</p></section></article></main><footer class="container d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-between align-items-center py-3 my-4 border-top"><div class="col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center"><a href=https://sensorlab.github.io/ class="mb-3 me-2 mb-md-0 text-body-secondary text-decoration-none lh-1"><img src=https://sensorlab.github.io/images/sensorlab-color.min.svg style=height:2.5rem></a>
