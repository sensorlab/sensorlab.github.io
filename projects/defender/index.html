Modeling security threats and defining protective measures. Design and implementation of advanced data processing algorithms for detection, identification and localization of cyber-physical threats based on data from synchrophasor measurement (SPM) units deployed in the energy grid. Pilot demonstration and validation of SPM based threat detection in a real operating environment.</p></section></article></main><footer class="container d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-between align-items-center py-3 my-4 border-top"><div class="col-md-6 d-flex align-items-center"><a href=https://sensorlab.github.io/ class="mb-3 me-2 mb-md-0 text-body-secondary text-decoration-none lh-1"><img src=https://sensorlab.github.io/images/sensorlab-color.min.svg style=height:2.5rem></a>
