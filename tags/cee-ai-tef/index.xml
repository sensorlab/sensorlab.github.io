It pioneers a Common Federated AI Testing and Experimentation Facility to bridge the gap between demand and limited availability of rigorously tested AI products. Aligned with European Commission initiatives, EnerTEF leverages foundational projects like the Common European Energy Data Space and AIoD. Through specialized &amp;lsquo;AI Living Labs,&amp;rsquo; EnerTEF fosters collaboration between energy stakeholders and AI developers to create adaptive models that align with evolving energy systems. &amp;lsquo;Bridging Centralized Access&amp;rsquo; ensures data privacy and security in federated testing, adhering to EU regulations and addressing ethical concerns. &amp;lsquo;Seamless Federated Integration&amp;rsquo; tackles integrating AI technologies across domains, enhancing cross-sector collaboration. &amp;lsquo;Long-term Sustainability and Go-to-Market Strategy&amp;rsquo; focuses on bringing AI innovations to market. In a nutshell, EnerTEF&amp;rsquo;s primary goal is to establish a Common European-scale Energy AI Federated TEF, facilitating extensive adaptation, validation, and upscale of AI tools and services across the energy sector. The project&amp;rsquo;s network of five primary nodes, complemented by three satellites, ensures a comprehensive approach to testing AI-based technologies in real-world operational environments. This setup contributes to the market uptake of trustworthy AI, ensuring their readiness, accessibility, and applicability to real-world scenarios.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
