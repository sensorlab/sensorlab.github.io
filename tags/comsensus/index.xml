The device detects and counts respiratory droplets, enabling smart, data-driven ventilation control that helps reducing infection risk – addressing a key public health challenge highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic.The technology was developed at the Jožef Stefan Institute. To raise the technology readiness level and bring solution closer to the market, the project received funding through RSF-IND call at JSI. Departments F5 and E6 are collaborating with industrial partners Nanotul d.o.o. and Comsensus d.o.o. to develop a market-ready device and further develop the technology.</description></item></channel></rss>
