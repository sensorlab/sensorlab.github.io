Research groups, industrial partners, and government representatives from all European member states have devised projects to perform proof-of-principle demonstrations of quantum communication and quantum key distribution (QKD). To this end, quantum communication infrastructure will be implemented on the national level in all EU member states to facilitate the international connection of those networks later. The Slovenian Quantum Communication Infrastructure Demonstration (SiQUID) project will be the first to implement quantum key distribution (QKD) in Slovenia. The project will establish quantum communication links between multiple government nodes in Slovenia and a test-bed quantum network between research institutions in Ljubljana for the research and development of advanced quantum communication protocols.</description></item></channel></rss>
